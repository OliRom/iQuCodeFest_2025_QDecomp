# Note for students:
# This Python file contains exactly the same code and exercises as 'bloch_sphere_dojo.ipynb'.
# There are NOT two different sets of exercisesâ€”both files are identical in content.
# The notebook ('bloch_sphere_dojo.ipynb') includes explanations and exercises, ideal for interactive learning.
# This Python file is provided for those who prefer working directly in a .py file instead of a notebook.
