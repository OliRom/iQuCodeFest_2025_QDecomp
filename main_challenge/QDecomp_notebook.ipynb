    "Each card of a player consists of a 3-qubit state. The *quantity* associated to this card is the measured value of the state in the computational basis (in binary). Because of that, each card can go from 0 to 7 points. At the beginning of the game, each player is provided with four states of the 3-qubit computational basis. Only two of them are known by the player. These states can be known exactly since they are eigenstates in the computational basis.\n",
